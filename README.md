# OCKcore

We refuse to be normal. It's the 21st century. But POSIX still has countless
features that no one will ever need.

Experience how computing should be.

## design

Many features in POSIX are of mostly historical value and do not serve
much purpose anymore. Chief among them are two digit years; they serve
no purpose nowadays and should be removed immediately.

The goal of OCKcore is to create a set of mostly POSIX compliant programs
that are not only small, but liberally licensed.

(Can GNU write `yes` in under 10 lines of source? I don't think so...)
